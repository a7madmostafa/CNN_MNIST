# DNN_MNIST
MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.  
I will make MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs -- 
i.e. it should stop training When it reaches 99% or greater and print out "Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!"
